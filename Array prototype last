Complexity
Time complexity: Thus, the operations inside the method are all constant time operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is:
𝑂(1)
Space complexity:
𝑂(1)


Code
Array.prototype.last = function() {
    if(this.length === 0){
        return -1;
    }
    return this[this.length-1]

};
